## Notes


### Pin code usage
To retrieve the state, send a `get` message to the device topic (`zigbee2mqtt/DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME/get`) with the body `{"pin_code":{"user":1}}`. To set, sent a `set` message to the device topic (`zigbee2mqtt/DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME/set`) with the body `{"pin_code":{"user":1,"pin_code":1234}}`. To clear a code, call `set` but omit the value for `pin_code`.

### Pin_code (composite)
Can be set by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"pin_code": {"user": VALUE, "pin_code": VALUE}}`
- `user` (numeric): User ID can only number 1. 
- `pin_code` (numeric): Pincode to set, set pincode(4 digit) to null to clear.
